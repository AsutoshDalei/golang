# Golang Learning Projects

Having worked extensively as a data scientist using Python, I am now exploring Go (Golang) to broaden my technical expertise and understand how different languages shape the way we solve problems. This repository documents my journey in learning Go, highlighting my initial experiments and projects.

## Project Descriptions

### Path Finding Algorithm

In this project, I implement a path finding algorithm as a way to familiarize myself with Go’s approach to data structures, algorithmic thinking, and code organization. The goal is to compare how Go handles these concepts in contrast to Python, and to build a foundation for more complex projects in the future.

### Interacting with Ollama Llama3.2

Here, I explore how Go can be used to interact with the Ollama Llama3.2 model. This project serves as an introduction to integrating Go with modern AI tools, allowing me to experiment with large language models outside the Python ecosystem. Through this, I aim to assess Go’s suitability and unique advantages in AI-related workflows.

These projects represent my first steps in learning Go, reflecting both my curiosity and commitment to continuous professional growth.
