# Dijkstra's Path Finder in Go

This project is a Go implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. As a data scientist with a background in Python, I created this project to learn Go’s approach to data structures, file handling, and algorithm implementation.

The program reads node and edge data from JSON files, constructs a graph, and computes the shortest path between specified nodes using Dijkstra’s algorithm. This exercise provides practical insight into Go’s type system, error handling, and standard library features.
